# Skill Trigger Keywords (CN)

Date: 2026-01-07 10:22:42

## Decision
- Add common Chinese trigger keywords to repo workflow skill descriptions so agents are more likely to auto-invoke them on Chinese prompts.

## Skills Updated
- `repo-dev-loop`
- `task-slicer`
- `small-step-commits`

## Rationale
- Most prompts are Chinese; English-only descriptions reduce implicit invocation reliability.
