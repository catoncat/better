# Context
- User requested a new Quick Fix skill for this repo to focus on the described issue, fix quickly, and commit quickly.
- Install location clarified to repo-local `./.claude/skills/quickfix` (not global).

# Decisions
- Create new skill named `quickfix` under `/.claude/skills/quickfix` in this repo.
- Skill behavior: skip preflight checks (git status, lint, typecheck, tests, plan), focus on user-stated problem, implement and commit quickly.
- No packaging into `.skill` file.

# Plan
- Initialize skill scaffold with `init_skill.py`.
- Edit `SKILL.md` to reflect trigger/behavior and constraints.
- Add minimal guidance on commit style and check skipping.

# Findings
- Repo currently has uncommitted changes.
- Skill scaffold created at `/.claude/skills/quickfix`.

# Progress
- Conversation note created and filled.
- Initialized quickfix skill via init script.
- Replaced SKILL.md content with quickfix workflow.

# Errors
- Initial overwrite failed due to shell noclobber; fixed with >|.

# Open Questions
- None.
