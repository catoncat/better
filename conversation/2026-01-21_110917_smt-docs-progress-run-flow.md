# Context
User asked to continue with SMT docs; chosen to start run-flow docs per plan.

# Decisions
- Add run-flow docs for WorkOrder→Run and Readiness/Prep with data generation and management notes.

# Plan
- Next: write `03_run_flow/03_loading_flow.md`, then FAI/execution/OQC, then demo data + validation docs.

# Findings
- Readiness items include STENCIL/SOLDER_PASTE/EQUIPMENT/MATERIAL/ROUTE/LOADING; loading must be complete to pass.

# Progress
- Added `domain_docs/mes/smt_playbook/03_run_flow/01_work_order_to_run.md`.
- Added `domain_docs/mes/smt_playbook/03_run_flow/02_readiness_and_prep.md`.

# Errors
- None.

# Open Questions
- None.
