# SMT gap doc updates

## Context
- User requested SMT doc updates per provided plan (two doc files).
- Repo is dirty; target files already have edits in the working tree.

## Decisions
- Pending: whether to proceed in current worktree or create a new worktree.

## Plan
- Review target doc sections for required removals/renames.
- Apply edits to `smt_gap_design_suggestions.md`.
- Apply edits to `smt_gap_task_breakdown.md`.
- Validate numbering and consistency.

## Findings
- `smt_gap_design_suggestions.md` relevant anchors: Phase 3 section, 9.2 exemption section.
- The ColdStorageTemp row is already absent; only remaining related text is a bullet in 10.4 (`优先复用现有角色并显式授权`).

## Progress
- Created conversation note for tracking.

## Errors
