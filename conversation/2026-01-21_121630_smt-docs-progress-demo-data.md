# Context
Continuing SMT playbook docs with demo data blueprint and step-by-step recipe for realistic SMT runs.

# Decisions
- Document demo data blueprint separately from the step-by-step run recipe to support dataset planning vs execution scripts.

# Plan
- Next: write detailed validation checklists for loading, run/execution, and traceability.

# Findings
- Demo data should cover PASS/WARNING/FAIL, replace, FAI pass/fail, OQC pass/fail/no-rule, and trace output completeness.

# Progress
- Added `domain_docs/mes/smt_playbook/04_demo_data/01_demo_dataset_blueprint.md`.
- Added `domain_docs/mes/smt_playbook/04_demo_data/02_demo_run_recipe.md`.

# Errors
- None.

# Open Questions
- None.
