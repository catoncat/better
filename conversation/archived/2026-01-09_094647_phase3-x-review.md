## Context

- Requested: review `domain_docs/mes/plan/phase3_tasks.md` completion status, focusing only on items marked `[x]`.
- Follow-up: add “as-built / implementation entry points” under each `[x]` item, and create a timestamped conversation note.

## Decisions

- Treat `domain_docs/mes/plan/phase3_tasks.md` as the single progress tracker; keep `[x]` as the source of truth for “done”.
- Add lightweight “As-built（实现入口）” pointers directly under each `[x]` item/subtask to reduce drift and make reviews reproducible.

## Plan

- Enumerate all `[x]` items in `domain_docs/mes/plan/phase3_tasks.md`.
- For each, locate concrete implementation artifacts (schema/routes/services/scripts) and add pointers under the item.
- Record this review and the doc-linking decision in `conversation/`.

## Open Questions

- None.
