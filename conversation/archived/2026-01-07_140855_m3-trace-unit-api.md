# m3-trace-unit-api

## Context
- M3 Option A selected: API-first, unit-level traceability.
- Reviewed the traceability contract and the existing trace API implementation.

## Decisions
- Add a derived `value` field to unit trace `dataValues` for contract alignment, while keeping typed fields.

## Plan
- Update trace service and schema for `dataValues.value`.
- Run lint and typecheck; report any blockers.

## Open Questions
- Lint failures in unrelated files: fix now or skip for this task?
