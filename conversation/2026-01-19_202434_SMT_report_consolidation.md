# Decisions
- Retain `domain_docs/mes/spec/process/compair/codex_smt_flow_deep_analysis.md` as the authoritative version and remove duplicate reports.

# Plan
- Delete `codex_review_report.md` and `smt_flow_deep_analysis.md` under `domain_docs/mes/spec/process/compair/`.

# Findings
- Multiple SMT report files exist with overlapping content; user requested a single authoritative version.

# Progress
- Prepared to delete duplicates; authoritative file confirmed.

# Errors
- None.

# Open Questions
- None.
