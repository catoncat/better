# Task Queue Status

## Goal

Display the current state of the shared task queue for multi-AI coordination visibility.

## Workflow

1. Check if `.scratch/task-queue.md` exists:
   - If not, inform user: "No task queue found. Run `/mes-next` to triage and create tasks."
   - Exit.

2. Read and parse `.scratch/task-queue.md`.

3. Display summary:
   - Total tasks
   - Pending count
   - In-progress count (with claimer info)
   - Completed count

4. Display detailed status for each slice:
   - Task name
   - Status (with emoji: ⏳ pending, 🔄 in_progress, ✅ completed)
   - Claimed by (branch name if claimed)
   - Dependencies status

5. Highlight any issues:
   - Tasks blocked by incomplete dependencies
   - Long-running tasks (claimed > X hours ago)
   - Orphaned claims (branch no longer exists)

To claim a pending task: `/claim-task`
To mark your task complete: update `.scratch/task-queue.md` Status to `completed`
```

## Guardrails

- Read-only operation; do not modify the task queue
- If file format is invalid, warn and suggest regenerating via `/mes-next`
